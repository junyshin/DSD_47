\section{Introduction}
The enigma machine is a cipher machine which encrypts a string of words or numbers so that a non partisan will not be able to understand the message. This system was extensively used during the world war 1 and 2 by Germany to plan strategic assault to enemy territory. to encrypt the message, the machine used a set of mechanical rotors and electrical circuit. The each rotor can be set by rotating the rotor and ring, and by changing the encryption type. In total, there is 3 independent rotors. In the electrical circuit, there is a circuit called a reflector which creates another level of encryption by generation a secondary pattern. This complex encryption system is able to create over 158 million million million combinations with 10 pairs of 26 letters. This makes it almost impossible for a human to decrypt the code. To make it even harder and increase the odd, the combination was changed every 24 hours during world war 2. In the course of Digital System Design, we used VHDL to write electronic version of this mechanical system. This report will explain the procedure of creating this device using the Altera board.

\section{Designing of the Enigma machine}
Before jumping into the VHDL, we first must understand how to implement the mechanical machine to a hardware. In our case the Altera's Cyclone II FPGA model EP2C20F484C7.
